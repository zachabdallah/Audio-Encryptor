vscode server:

To make the environment:
python3 -m venv flask_audio_env
source flask_audio_env/bin/activate //activate environment
deactivate //leave environment


which python //get the environment location, for me it is /Users/zachabdallah/flask_audio_env/bin/python

now, use that as your interpreter for vscode as well

//in this environemnt: (flask_audio_env) zachabdallah@Zachs-MacBook-Air ~ %
//install all your stuff

pip install 
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install scipy
pip install matplotlib

//now you should be able to run the flask server
//you also don't need the terminal to be inside the environment anymore as you don't need to import anything. you can go ahad and type "deactivate" to go back to normal.


xcode:
you'll have to install the latest iOS version to be able to emulate an apple product unfortunately. In the top bar, it'll prompt you to download it.
I currently am using iOS 26.0.1

Now, in the top bar you can choose to emulate whatever iOS device you want. I'm using the iPhone 17. Now run the program and it'll bring the iphone app.
